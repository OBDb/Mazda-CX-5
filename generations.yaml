This compact crossover featured a distinctive exterior with flowing lines, a prominent front grille, and sporty proportions.

Transmission choices included six-speed manual and automatic, with front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations available. The interior offered a driver-focused layout with high-quality materials unusual for its class, featuring Mazda's first-generation infotainment system with available navigation. Standard and available safety features included blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and Smart City Brake Support. A refresh in 2016 brought additional sound insulation, improved interior materials, and an electronic parking brake.

    description: "The second-generation CX-5 refined Mazda's approach to the compact crossover segment with more sophisticated styling, premium interior appointments, and enhanced technology. The exterior evolved Mazda's KODO design language with a cleaner, more elegant appearance featuring a longer hood, slimmer headlights, and a more prominent grille. Initially powered by carried-over 2.0L and 2.5L SkyActiv-G engines, the lineup expanded in 2019 to include a turbocharged 2.5L option producing up to 250 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque with premium fuel. A 2.2L SkyActiv-D diesel briefly joined the North American lineup in 2019. Six-speed automatic transmission remained standard, with manual option discontinued in most markets. The interior saw a substantial upgrade with higher quality materials throughout, including available Nappa leather and genuine wood trim on higher trims. Technology advanced with a 7-inch (later 10.25-inch) infotainment display using Mazda Connect interface, available head-up display, and expanded safety features through i-Activsense suite. G-Vectoring Control enhanced handling by subtly modulating engine torque in response to steering inputs. Significant updates in 2022 brought refreshed styling, improved technology with standard 10.25-inch display, updated interior with new seats designed to better support the spine's natural curve, and enhanced all-wheel drive with off-road mode. Throughout its production, the second-generation CX-5 has progressively moved upmarket with each update, reflecting Mazda's broader strategy to position itself as a premium alternative to mainstream brands while maintaining the engaging driving dynamics that distinguish the brand."
